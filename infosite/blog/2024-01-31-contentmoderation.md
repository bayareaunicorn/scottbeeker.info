It's up to us as platforms to put in place AI systems for live detection as well as a live content moderator staff to combat Suicide, CSE, and Terrorism. We must train our LLM systems to look for certain keywords and have live staff with the ability to reach out to law enforcement without creating backdoors within our systems to preserve free speech.

## 1996 Sec 230
Section 230 is a part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which was enacted as part of the larger Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
Section 230 has been instrumental in shaping the internet as we know it today. It has allowed users and services to forward email, host online reviews, or share photos or videos without the fear of being sued for content that others might find objectionable.
2007 - 2008 The rise of the smartphone 
Apple's first iPhone was introduced in 2007, While the first Android smartphone was released a year later, in 2008. This marked the beginning of a new age of consumerism and communication. 
2008 The year of the platform
The year 2008 was a significant period for social media, with several platforms experiencing growth and increased user engagement.
 
Facebook was a major player in the social media landscape, standing out as a "social gorilla" that was taking share from not only other social networks but also blogs and other social media platforms. By the end of the year, Facebook nearly caught up with MySpace in terms of traffic, with MySpace having 58.4 million unique visitors in December and Facebook close behind with 55.2 million.
MySpace, while still a significant platform in 2008, saw a slight decline in traffic and time spent on the site.
Twitter, launched in 2006, was gaining traction and becoming a popular platform for sharing news and updates. By 2008, it had become a main social media platform for many users.
LinkedIn was also part of the landscape in 2008, having been around since 2003. By 2008, it had crossed 175 million users and a market capitalization of $10 billion.

As social media continues to grow in popularity old and upcoming platforms need to set certain measures and say goodbye to the wild west days of "You've Got Mail".
