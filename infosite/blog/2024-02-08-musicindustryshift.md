# Ads, Layoffs, and Tours the shift of the music industry


<!--truncate-->
## Consumer Price Hikes on streaming platforms..
In 2024, several popular streaming platforms have increased their subscription prices. This trend is seen across both video and music streaming services, reflecting a broader industry shift.
 
Netflix, a popular video streaming platform, now offers a $6.99 per month subscription, which is ad-supported. This allows users to enjoy movies and TV shows at a lower price. The standard plan, which does not include ads, costs $15.49 a month. For access to more devices, the cost goes up to $22.99 a month. Adding additional people that aren't included in your subscription will cost you an additional $7.99 per person per month.
Spotify, a leading music streaming service, has also increased its prices. The most expensive plan that Spotify offers is the Family Premium, which allows up to six household members to stream music without advertisements. This plan now costs $16.99 per month, which is $1 more than before. Spotify also operates two types of subscription plans: a Free account and a Premium account. The Free account comes with ads, while the Premium account, which requires a paid subscription, does not.
YouTube has also seen changes in its pricing structure. YouTube Select packages the top 5% of YouTube's most-viewed content in categories like food, entertainment, and music. The prices for these packages can vary significantly based on how deals are structured with Google. YouTube Music, a music streaming service from YouTube, has increased the price of its individual music plan from $8.99 per month to $10.99.
Other music streaming services have followed suit. Apple Music raised its prices in October by $1 for individual users and by $2 for families, to $10.99 and $16.99 per month, respectively. Amazon Music increased its Unlimited Individual Plan from $9.99 to $10.99 per month, while raising its student pricing from $4.99 to $5.99 per month.

## Facing the Music..
The music industry has experienced a significant number of layoffs in 2024, following a period of growth fueled by the pandemic. As the effects of the pandemic have subsided, many companies have found themselves overstaffed and have had to make difficult decisions to adjust.
 
Warner Music announced that it would lay off 10% of its staff, which equates to around 600 people. This decision was made in an effort to double down on their core business and seize new opportunities in the music industry. The layoffs will primarily affect the company's owned and operated media properties, including Uproxx, HipHopDX, IMGN, and Interval Presents.
Universal Music is also facing challenges. After years of a streaming boom, the company is now searching for its next big win. This suggests that the company may also be considering layoffs as part of its strategy to adapt to changing market conditions.
The layoffs in the music industry are part of a larger trend across the tech sector. Many tech companies, including those outside of the music industry, have been trimming their workforce after pandemic-fueled growth has died out. In 2024 alone, an estimated 33,800 total employees were impacted in the tech sector.

## Direct to Consumer new platforms new experiences...
The shift from plane streaming to a more interactive experience between the artist and consumer is under research by Universal Music and seen with upcoming platforms such as HopHippy, with Merchandise, Tours, and a shift from the traditional cover art streaming experience. What will 2024 and beyond bring for the entertainment industry?
