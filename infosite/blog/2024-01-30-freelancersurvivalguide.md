As we head into the second month of the new year more and more remote workers are saying goodbye to there local coffee shop and home office, but for some platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr is more than just a passive income. 

 Free Falling off the cloud

"Google has been undergoing a series of layoffs in 2024, with more than 1,000 employees affected so far."

As of January 25, 82 tech companies have laid off 23,670 workers. By the end of January, the number of tech workers laid off in the first weeks of 2024 was nearly 25,000.
 
The layoffs in the tech industry, including the cloud sector, have been attributed to several factors. Some Silicon Valley executives have suggested that the cuts are a result of over-hiring during the pandemic and the impact of high inflation. Other analysts suggest that tech companies are chasing efficiency for the new year, which might lead to more job cuts in the coming months, even as AI-related roles might flourish at a smaller scale.

Developers..Developers..Developers.. From $30hr to $500k/yr 

Freelance developers on Upwork have a wide range of earning potential, depending on their skills, experience, and the demand for their services.
 
For instance, a web developer on Upwork can charge anywhere from $30 to over $120 per hour The rates for front-end developers and full-stack developers can start from $35 and $55 per hour respectively, with more experienced developers charging higher rates
However, making a substantial income like $500k a year as a freelancer on Upwork, while possible, is not common and can be challenging. It requires a high level of expertise, a strong reputation on the platform, and the ability to consistently secure high-paying projects. For example, an SEO consultant reported making almost $500,000 on Upwork in a year, but this level of success is not typical for most freelancers.
Factors Influencing Earnings
Several factors can influence a freelancer's earnings on Upwork. These include:
Experience and Expertise: The more experienced and skilled a freelancer is, the higher their potential earnings. For example, a developer with experience in building complex business intelligence dashboards or working with specific technologies can charge higher rates.
Location: The location of the freelancer can also play a role in their earnings. Developers in regions with higher costs of living often charge higher rates.
Type of Engagement: Whether a freelancer is working alone or as part of an agency can also influence their earnings. Working as part of an agency can sometimes be more cost-effective, as the agency may provide access to a range of skills and services.
In conclusion, while it is possible for a highly skilled and experienced freelance developer to earn $500k a year on Upwork, it is not the norm. The earning potential of freelancers on the platform can vary widely based on factors such as their skills, experience, location, and the type of projects they undertake.

Ready.. Set.. Voiceover..

"Started in February  2010 Fiverr has exploded in a multimillion creator marketplace."
Not everyones a developer but that shouldn't discourage you from from earning a passive or even a fulltime income online. One of the best platforms to find voiceover talent is Fiverr. Fiverr is home to various creators and has been a trusted platform for over 10 years. 
Start Small and Grow..
While some gigs are still going for $5 most quality gigs are going for $20+. Build feedback by offering gigs for a lower price $5 - $10 and work your way up the order queue ladder with more reviews and more returning customers. Most customers are third party resellers of your service. Speak another language? Even better Bilingual gigs are top rated in the voice actor category and bringing in substantial passive income for many creators just like you.
Remember, success on Fiverr can take time and requires patience. It's important to be realistic about what you can achieve on this platform. Unless you have a large following and are well-known in the voiceover community, you are likely to only receive small jobs but like any ecommerce website or trusted business reviews can make the difference between an order or ghost browser.
